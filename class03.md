## Decisions and Loops
we have already covered some of these last read ,for today we will examin these :
- If..Else statment :If statment checks a condition if it resolves true it excute the code if it comes out false it will excute the code after else .
- switch statment : A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
