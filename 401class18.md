### Questions:

**What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?**

By transforming data into packets, the data can be sent to its destination by the best available route.  This means that not all packets have to be sent along the same route (which may not be equally efficient for all packets).  After transmission, the packets an be reassembled into the the complete data that they began as.

**UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?**

A connection requires a 'handshake' in which the receiver agrees to the communication before data is sent.  Because UDP sends data without confirmation, it can be considered a connectionless protocol

**Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?**

Yes, socket server applications can accommodate many socket connections at once.

**Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?**

A client application can connect to multiple socket servers, but each individual socket client can only connect to one server at a time.   Therefore, the client application would need to have multiple client sockets in order to connect with multiple socket servers simultaneously

**Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?**

To the best of my understanding, an application can run both client and server sockets - however, the same socket cannot perform both tasks simultaneously
