# CSS GRID

My NOTES on Display grid :

1. You start the grid by adding display:grid to the container of the elements you want to use it on .

2. grid-column-start :x  which is another way of saying the xth vertical border from the left in the grid.it can take negative values

3. grid-column-end :x and end at the xth  opposite to the start variant.like it's brother it can take negative values

4. Instead of defining a grid item based on the start and end positions of the grid lines, you can define it based on your desired column width using the span keyword. Keep in mind that span only works with positive values.

5. typing both grid-column-start and grid-column-end every time can get tiring. Fortunately, grid-column is a shorthand property that can accept both values at once, separated by a slash.

6. everything said so for works on the grid-row part instead of column .

7. f typing out both grid-column and grid-row is too much for you, there's yet another shorthand for that. grid-area accepts four values separated by slashes: grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, followed by grid-column-end.

One example of this would be grid-area: 1 / 1 / 3 / 6;.
8.  We can override this using the order property, which is one of the advantages of grid over table-based layout. By default, all grid items have an order of 0, but this can be set to any positive or negative value, similar to z-index.
9. Grid-template-columns: you can assign the number of the columns and there size in relative to the window screen.
10. grid-template-columns doesn't just accept values in percentages, but also length units like pixels and ems. You can even mix different units together.
11. Grid also introduces a new unit, the fractional fr. Each fr unit allocates one share of the available space. For example, if two elements are set to 1fr and 3fr respectively, the space is divided into 4 equal shares; the first element occupies 1/4 and the second element 3/4 of any leftover space.
