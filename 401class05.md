# Linked Lists

Linked Lists are linear data structures, meaning that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

Linked Lists are similar to arrays - HOWEVER where arrays require memory in a contiguous block, linked lists do not need to be contiguous because they contain references to the next (and sometimes prior) node in the list. They are dynamic data structures (as opposed to arrays, which are considered static data structures)

In addition to singly linked lists (which contain a next reference) and doubly linked lists (which contain both a next and previous reference) one can make a circular linked list that begins with a 'tail' and then goes on to reference the next/prior node in a loop (instead of ending in a null value) - excluding the tail from the loop so that we have a starting point to work with.

Big O Notation is a way to evaluate the performance of an algorithm based on efficiency - specifically in terms of time and memory

When adding new nodes to a linked list, one needs to update the references not just in the new node, but also in any node affected (always the prior node, and in the case of a doubly linked list the next node as well)

Because of the nature of linked lists, when inserting a new node we need to traverse the current list as far as the point where we want to insert the new node in order to create the references correctly.

This means that inserting new nodes at the head of the list is always the most efficient place to add a node, and becomes less efficient the farther down the list you need to add a node.
Overall, arrays are preferable if you:

- know the size of the list upfront
- need random access to elements
- want to iterate quickly through the elements


Alternately, linked lists are preferable if you:

- do not know the size of the list upfront
- do not need random access to elements
- primarily want to add or remove elements
