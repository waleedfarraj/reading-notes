### Questions:

**Does a deployed React application require a server?**

You do not need a web server in order to run a React app - React builds a virtual DOM and does its diff operations on the client's browser

**Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?**

Unit testing looks at code in isolation whereas behavior-driven testing looks at overall outcomes of the system.  Because React is state based and focused on user experience, behavioral testing is more in line with the ethos of React app development.

**What does npm run build do?**

npm run build runs the build field from the package.json scripts field

**Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application**

React is by nature a very modular way of building an app.  'It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".'
