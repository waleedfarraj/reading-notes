Parents cannot directly access the state of a child component, but the state can be accessed through the use of callback functions.

**How can a child component “know” the state of another component?**

Components cannot proactively access the state of other components - however, you can pass a component's state to its child components as props and if components share a common ancestor, they can access the same state in a similar manner.
