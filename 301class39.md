### Questions:

**What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?**

useEffect can be used effectively to run any async functions needed on loading and seed your store with data.

**When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?**

Thunk middleware works by allowing you to write action creators that return a function rather than an action.  The inner function that is exported receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters
