### Questions:

**What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?**

Web sockets allow a single TCP socket connection to be hijacked so that the client-server relationship can relay bi-directional, full-duplex messages instantaneously.  This means that messages can be sent and received in real time and memory use is configurable.

**Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?**

Yes - socket.io is a communication library that uses websockets where appropriate, however initial connection setup is done over HTTP.  HTTP is also useful for some transports, and can serve as a fallback for websockets.

**What happens when a client emits an event?**

Events emitted by the client are sent to the server to be handled.

**What happens when a server emits an event?**

Events emitted by the server can be sent to all connected clients or to a specified segment of clients by specifying a namespace or room.  Clients who receive the event may have functions in place to handle the event.

**What happens if a client “misses” an event?**

Missed events are analogous to unhandled events - nothing 'happens'.

**How can we mitigate this?**

- Confirm that event handlers are in place to perform necessary actions meant to be triggered by events.
- Include error handlers as a second layer of event handling if things don't work as intended
