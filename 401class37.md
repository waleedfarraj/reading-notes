### Questions:

**Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?**

Redux is optimized for large apps with high-frequency state changes.  This is because Redux is able to selectively re-render only those components that are updated whereas Context API prompts a re-render of all components on each update of the state.

**What is the purpose of a reducer?**

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store

**What does an action contain?**

Actions are objects that contain a type property (typically a string) that indicates the type of action being performed, as well as a payload (which could be any type of value)

**Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?**

Redux uses shallow equality checking to compare the immutable state to the possibly-mutated state that is returned by the reducer after being passed the current state.  If the state that comes back from the reducer is different than the root state, then the altered object will be returned for rendering - otherwise, the current state object is returned.
