# Read: 11 - EJS

## What is EJS?

What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

first of all you need to use npm install ejs to use this and as we do with express and cors we assign a variable to require ejs then you feed it a template file  and an output file in the cli.and you can use variables to inject arrays  and much more .
