# Read: 05 - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text
## Images 
Adding Images ,we use the img tag and we add the
 src that can be the path to image or the link we use
  alt to have that text be next to the image .

`<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." />`
Three Rules for
Creating Images
There are three rules to remember when you
are creating images for your website which are
summarized below. We go into greater detail
on each topic over the next nine pages.

1. Save images in the right format

Websites mainly use images in
jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image
format then your image might
not look as sharp as it should
and can make the web page
slower to load.

2. Save images at the right size

You should save the image at
the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If
the image is smaller than the
width or height that you have
specified, the image can be
distorted and stretched. If the
image is larger than the width
and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to
display on the page.

3. Use the correct resolution

Computer screens are made up
of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made
up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch,
and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels
per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in
images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to
download.

### When to use what format

Whenever you have many different
colors in a picture you should use a JPEG.
A photograph that features snow or an
overcast sky might look like it has large
areas that are just white or gray, but the
picture is usually made up of many different
colors that are subtly different.

Use GIF or PNG format
when saving images
with few colors or large
areas of the same color.

## Color
color can make your page come to life , you can assign
 the color by its name or rgb value or hsa value or even 
 the hex code value .Every color on a computer screen is 
 created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find 
 the color you want, you can use a color picker.
 When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.
CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).

## text 
The properties that allow you to control
the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)

1. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters).

### type scales

You may have noticed that programs such as
Word, Photoshop and InDesign offer the same
sizes of text.This is because they are set
according to a scale or ratio that
was developed by European
typographers in the sixteenth
century.
It is considered that this scale
for type is pleasing to the eye
and it has therefore changed
little in the last 400 years.
