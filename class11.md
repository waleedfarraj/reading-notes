## images

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.
Rather than using the ```<img>``
element's align attribute, web
page authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. 
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.
and you can control how many times
you want to repeat in the x direction 
or the y direction or none for not repeating 
once ,or you can assign background postion
Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it. To reduce the number 
of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

## practical information
Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.
At the heart of SEO is the idea of
working out which terms people
are likely to enter into a search
engine to find your site and then
using these terms in the right
places on your site to increase
the chances that search engines
will show a link to your site in
their results.
In order to determine who comes
first in the search results, search
engines do not only look at what
appears on your site. They also
consider how many sites link
to you (and how relevant those
links are). For this reason, SEO
is often split into two areas:
on-page techniques and off-page
techniques.
On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.
Getting other sites to link to you
is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help
determine how to rank your
site by looking at the number of
other sites that link to yours.
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability
1. Page title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link text
6. image ALT text 
7. Page descriptions

Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.
Brain storm List down the words that
someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure
to include the various topics,
products or services your site is
about.Group the keywords into
separate lists for the different
sections or categories of your
website.There are several tools that let
you enter your keywords and
then they will suggest additional
keywords you might like to It is very unlikely that your
site will appear at the top of
the search results for every
keyword. This is especially true
for topics where there is a lot
of competition. The more sites
out there that have already been
optimized for a given keyword,
the harder it will be for you to
rise up the search results when
people search on that term.
Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.
Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.
