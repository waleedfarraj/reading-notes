WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. In objects variables are known as proprties
and in an object function is knows as a method.
Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a
name and a value. In an object, that name is called a key.
An object cannot have two keys with the same name. This is
because keys are used to access their corresponding values. 

WHAT IS DOM ?
The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

The dom tree is a model of a web page as a browser As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
It consists of four main types of nodes :

1. THE DOCUMENT NODE 
1. ELEMNET NODE
1. ATTRIBUTE NODES 
1. TEXT NODES 

You can get element from the the method by get element you can also loop over nodelist and applay the same 
statment to each .TRAVERSING THE DOM When you have an element node, you can select
another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.
