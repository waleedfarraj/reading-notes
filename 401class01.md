1. array.map runs over every element in the array and returns a new array depending on the code inside it .

1. array.reduce runs over the elements in the array and returns a snigle value depending on the accumaltor  you have choosen.

1.  - ```superagent.get(url) ```

      ```.then(result=>{ console.log(‘results:‘,result.body); })```

    - ```let getDataFromUrl = (url) => new Promise( (resolve,reject) => {```
              ```if( superagent.get(url) ) { resolve(OK) }```
              ```else { reject(BAD Request) }```
```});```

```async function getData(url) {```
     ```try {```
             ```let result = await getDataFromUrl(url);```
             ```console.log(result);```
             ```} catch(e) {            console.error(err); }```
```}```

4.  The promise in js is just like promise in real life it has three states you are  doing it which is the pending state it can be fulfilled in the end or it will fail which is the rejection in js you can have callback functions to handle any of those two possiable outcomes .

5. No most of them are but  there are those synch  call back functions, Examples:

   - EventEmitter (depends on when the event is fired)
   - Array iteration methods like forEach
   - Array sort comparator callbacks
   - String replace match callbacks
