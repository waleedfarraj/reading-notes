Routes can be managed in separate modules from the main server, allowing us to extract that logic and wiring to be more topical.

How does this change the serverâ€™s role?  For one thing, this should make our code more DRY and readable.

index.js - Entry Point
server.js - Hub, Exported Server
models/categories.js, etc - Data Models
routes/categories.js, etc - Routers and Handlers

## [Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

* **routing**: how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests

* Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions

|Response Method|Description|
|:--|--:|
|res.download()| Prompt a file to be downloaded|
|res.end()|End the response process|
|res.json()|Send a JSON response|
|res.jsonp()|Send a JSON response with JSONP support|
|res.redirect()|Redirect a request|
|res.render()|Render a view template|
|res.send()|Send a response of various types|
|res.sendFile()|Send a file as an octet stream|
|res.sendStatus()|Set the response status code and send its string representation as the response body|

* **app.route()** can be used to create a chainable route handler for a route path

* **express.Router()** class can be used to create  modular, mountable route handlers
