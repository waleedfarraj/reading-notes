### Questions:

**Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?**

Parents have to share their states (and any other information they wish to pass along) by passing props to their child components.

**When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?**

Wrapped components receive all the props of the container - along with any additional props that may be passed - and is rendered based on those props.


**Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?**

Yes - components are modular, reusable pieces of code that can be rendered multiple times if need be.

**What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children**

A spread operator can be used as a cleaner way to pass all props without having to retype them.  For example:

```
const IntermediateComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <ChildComponent prop1={props.prop1} prop2={props.prop2} />
  )
}
```
can instead be written as
```
const IntermediateComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <ChildComponent {...props} />
  )
}
```
