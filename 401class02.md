1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
 This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

 2. What is the difference between a module and a package?
 6

A module is a single JavaScript file that has some reasonable functionality.
A package is one or more modules (libraries) grouped (or packaged) together. These are commonly used by other packages or a project of your own. Node.js uses a package manager, where you can find and install thousands of packages.

3. What does the node package manager do? Node Package Manager (NPM) is a command line tool that installs, updates or uninstalls Node.js packages in your application. It is also an online repository for open-source Node.js packages. The node community around the world creates useful modules and publishes them as packages in this repository.

4. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module ?                            module.exports = {
    method: function() {},
    otherMethod: function() {},
};
exports.method = function() {};
exports.otherMethod = function() {};

  - Node ecosystem; i couldn't fine a clear defenation online but as i understand it is the relation between the sever js file and the modulus and the dependcies and the relation between them how they codepend on each other to achive the goal of running the smoothest service .
  - Node.js ; is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
  - V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.
  - A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet.
  - Interpreter is a program that executes instructions written in a high-level language. There are two ways to run programs written in a high-level language. The most common is to compile the program; the other method is to pass the program through an interpreter.
  - In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program.
