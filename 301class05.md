#  HEROKU

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.
Heroku is the quickest way for a company to become an apps company. Heroku is a service that enables companies to spend their time developing and deploying apps that immediately start producing value.
Heroku is an amazing developer experience. Heroku gets out of the way where it matters, letting devs get on with what they do best - developing apps.
Data lies at the heart of any significant app — whether it's customer data or data about the service it provides — an app and its data go hand in hand. Heroku's rich ecosystem of managed data services includes Heroku Postgres, Heroku Redis and Apache Kafka on Heroku.

Developers shouldn't need to discover how to optimally provision a database through trial and error - but instead have immediate access to a scalable, highly available database with rollback - one that supports their apps and development style.
Heroku is an ecosystem of cloud services, which can be used to instantly extend applications with fully-managed services.

Heroku lets you externalize configuration - storing data such as encryption keys or external resource addresses in config vars.

At runtime, config vars are exposed as environment variables to the application. For example, modify index.js so that it introduces a new route, /times, that repeats an action depending on the value of the TIMES environment variable. Under the existing get() call, add another:
```
.get('/times', (req, res) => res.send(showTimes()))
```

At the end of the file, add the following definition for the new function, showTimes():

```
showTimes = () => {
  let result = '';
  const times = process.env.TIMES || 5;
  for (i = 0; i < times; i++) {
    result += i + ' ';
  }
  return result;
}
```
heroku local will automatically set up the environment based on the contents of the .env file in your local directory. In the top-level directory of your project, there is already a .env file that has the following contents:

```IMES=2```
If you run the app with heroku local, you’ll see two numbers will be generated every time.

To set the config var on Heroku, execute the following:

heroku config:set TIMES=2
View the config vars that are set using heroku config:
```
heroku config
== sharp-rain-871 Config Vars
PAPERTRAIL_API_TOKEN: erdKhPeeeehIcdfY7ne
TIMES: 2
```
Deploy your changed application to Heroku and then visit it by running heroku open times.

## Adding Data Base
Provision a database
The add-on marketplace has a large number of data stores, from Redis and MongoDB providers, to Postgres and MySQL. In this step, you will add a free Heroku Postgres Starter Tier dev database to your app.
