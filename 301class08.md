# SQL

SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database. This tutorial will provide you with the instruction on the basics of each of these commands as well as allow you to put them to practice using the SQL Interpreter.

The select statement is used to query the database and retrieve selected data that match the criteria that you specify. Here is the format of a simple select statement:

select "column1"
  [,"column2",etc] 
  from "tablename"
  [where "condition"];
  [] = optional
The column names that follow the select keyword determine which columns will be returned in the results. You can select as many column names that you'd like, or you can use a "*" to select all columns.

The table name that follows the keyword from specifies the table that will be queried to retrieve the desired results.

The where clause (optional) specifies which data values or rows will be returned or displayed, based on the criteria described after the keyword where.

Conditional selections used in the where clause:

=	Equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal
<=	Less than or equal
<>	Not equal to
LIKE	*See note below
The LIKE pattern matching operator can also be used in the conditional selection of the where clause. Like is a very powerful operator that allows you to select only rows that are "like" what you specify. The percent sign "%" can be used as a wild card to match any possible character that might appear before or after the characters specified. For example:

select first, last, city
   from empinfo
   where first LIKE 'Er%';
This SQL statement will match any first names that start with 'Er'. Strings must be in single quotes.

Or you can specify,

select first, last
   from empinfo
   where last LIKE '%s';
This statement will match any last names that end in a 's'.

select * from empinfo
   where first = 'Eric';
This will only select rows where the first name equals 'Eric' exactly.

Sample Table: empinfo
first	last	id	age	city	state
John	Jones	99980	45	Payson	Arizona
Mary	Jones	99982	25	Payson	Arizona
Eric	Edwards	88232	32	San Diego	California
Mary Ann	Edwards	88233	32	Phoenix	Arizona
Ginger	Howell	98002	42	Cottonwood	Arizona
Sebastian	Smith	92001	23	Gila Bend	Arizona
Gus	Gray	22322	35	Bagdad	Arizona
Mary Ann	May	32326	52	Tucson	Arizona
Erica	Williams	32327	60	Show Low	Arizona
Leroy	Brown	32380	22	Pinetop	Arizona
Elroy	Cleaver	32382	22	Globe	Arizona
Enter the following sample select statements in the SQL Interpreter Form at the bottom of this page. Before you press "submit", write down your expected results. Press "submit", and compare the results.

select first, last, city from empinfo; 

select last, city, age from empinfo
       where age > 30; 

select first, last, city, state from empinfo
       where first LIKE 'J%'; 

select * from empinfo; 

select first, last, from empinfo
       where last LIKE '%s'; 

select first, last, age from empinfo
       where last LIKE '%illia%'; 

select * from empinfo where first = 'Eric';

This unique SQL Tutorial is the "sequel" to the highly successful SQLCourse.com site and will provide you with more advanced easy-to-follow SQL Instruction and the ability to practice what you learn on-line with immediate feedback! You will receive immediate results on a web page after submitting your SQL Commands.

This continuation course will provide you with critical need-to-know advanced features and clauses of the SELECT statement that weren't supported in the previous SQLCourse.com site. Everything you learn here will be ANSI SQL compliant and should work with most SQL databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, mySQL, MS Access, Informix, Sybase, or any other ANSI SQL compliant database.

If you're already familar with the basics of SQL, you can still use this as a refresher, and practice some SQL statements.
