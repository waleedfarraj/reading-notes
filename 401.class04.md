## questions

__Why would a developer choose to make data models?__

Before adding data to a database, a developer would need to assess how to structure their schema (in the case of a SQL database) or how they would set up information within a collection (in the case of a NoSQL database). By making a data model, the developer would be able to get a handle on what data they are dealing with and what would be the most useful way of organizing that data within a database so that they can have a plan for what that database will actually look like.

__What purpose do CRUD operations serve?__

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) describes the four functions that are necessary in any application that involve a database. This means that the application should allow one to create new entries in the database, access the information within the database, alter/update the information in the database, and remove entries from the database as needed. Without CRUD, one would not have full access to the database that they are interacting with.

__What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?__

- Postgres is a SQL database (specifically, an open source object-relational database system).
- MongoDB is a NoSQL database (specifically, a document-based distributed database)

__What is Mongoose and why do we need it?__

Mongoose is an Object Document Mapper that allows one to define objects with a strongly-typed schema that is mapped to a MongoDB document. My understanding at this time is that while Mongoose is not strictly necessary to use MongoDB, it can help to bridge the gap between SQL and NoSQL data by mapping a user-defined schema onto a Mongo document.
